	<h1>7 - Getting Game FPS</h1>
	<p>
		We'll be getting the game's frame rate (and changing the text's color).
	</p>
	<h3>Setting Up</h3>
	<p>
		Add a text object, add a text property, add an always sensor and a python controller,
		connect them, create a text file and connect them. Yes those bricks belong to the text object.
	</p>
	<h3>The code</h3>
	<p>
		To get the game framerate we should importing the game engine's logic function
		<span class="mono">Range.logic.getAverageFrameRate()</span> whose return type is a <b>float</b>.
		And then the code looks like this.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-python">import Range
cont = Range.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner

FPS = Range.logic.getAverageFrameRate()</code></pre>
	<p>
		Here we've defined <b>FPS</b> as that <span title="which is Range.logic.getAverageFrameRate()">function</span>.
		Now to get the fps and put it on the text, the code looks like this.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-python">import Range
cont = Range.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner

FPS = Range.logic.getAverageFrameRate()
own["Text"] = str(FPS)</code></pre>
	<p>
		Now run the game. If you see our text object is not getting the framerate but stays
		at <b>0.0</b>, the reason is: <u>Getting a game's frame is happening everyframe</u>,
		and since our always logic brick is triggered once, it stays at zero.
		So go ahead and turn on true level triggering. Now it should work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Don't worry if you have a lenghty going numbers like this.

	<p>
		There's an in-built python function called <span class="mono">substring</span>
		which is used to show a part of the string. On the line <u>own["Text"] = str(FPS)</u>
		put <span class="mono">[:5]</span>. The code looks like this.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-python">import Range
cont = Range.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner

FPS = Range.logic.getAverageFrameRate()
own["Text"] = str(FPS)[:5]</code></pre>
	<p>
		This means the text object only display <b>5 characters</b>.
		Now let's change the color of the text using the function <span class="mono">color</span>,
		which belongs to the class <span class="mono">KX_GameObject</span>.
		Our text object belongs to the class <span class="mono">KX_FontObject</span> which
		is a subclass of <b>KX_GameObject</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The code looks like this.
	</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = 1
if FPS <= 60.1:
    own.color = 0,1,0,a
elif FPS <= 30:
    own.color = 1,1,0,a
elif FPS <= 20:
    own.color = 1,0,0,a
else:
    own.color = 0,0,1,a</code></pre>
    <p>
    	What is actually happening here?
    	Well, we are making our text object to turn green when the framerate is at or below 60.
    	Turn yellow when the framerate is at or below 30 and turn red when the framerate is at
    	or below 20. If its not anything specified turn blue.
    </p>
    <p>
    	<span class="mono">color</span> accepts 4 arguments which are <u>red, green, blue and alpha</u>.
    	Values range from 0 and 1. <span class="mono">a</span> means alpha channel, I'll leave alpha as 1.
    </p>
	<ul>
		<li> <u>0,1,0,a</u> is <b>green</b> </li>
		<li> <u>1,1,0,a</u> is <b>yellow</b> </li>
		<li> <u>1,0,0,a</u> is <b>red</b> </li>
		<li> <u>0,0,1,a</u> is <b>blue</b> </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
    	If you still don't understand you can play with the Blender's built-in color picker.

    	Back to our stuff, the full code looks like this.
    </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import Range
cont = Range.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner

FPS = Range.logic.getAverageFrameRate()

own["Text"] = str(FPS)[:5]

a = 1

if FPS <= 60.1:
    own.color = 0,1,0,a
elif FPS <= 30:
    own.color = 1,1,0,a
elif FPS <= 20:
    own.color = 1,0,0,a
else:
    own.color = 0,0,1,a</code></pre>
